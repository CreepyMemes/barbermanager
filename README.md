## Overview

BarberManager is a containerized barber shop management system web application.

It provides an appointment booking system for clients, availability management for barbers, and automated reminders.

The tech stack uses **React** (Vite) frontend, **Django** backend, and relies on **Docker Compose** for easy cross-platform development & deployment.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (+ [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers))

### Development Workflow

This section is about the development workflow in programming and testing the application on local machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to run **VSCode** inside the backend container.
> When you open the project `backend` or `frontend` foldlers in **VSCode**,
> it shoullt automaticaly detect the `.devcontainer` configurations.
>
> If it doesn't detect it or you ignore the notification you can:
> Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
> Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

#### Clone the repository

If the repository is public:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreepyMemes/barbermanager.git
cd barbermanager/
```

If the repository is private:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change **TOKEN** to your github token

```bash
git clone https://CreepyMemes:TOKEN@github.com/CreepyMemes/barbermanager.git
cd barbermanager
```

#### Build and launch all containers

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### (Optional) Reset dev environment

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## Development Guide

### Backend (Django)

The Django dev server reloads automatically on code changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -it backend sh
> ```

#### Environment setup

Create `.env.local` for SMTP/email:

```sh
EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST='smtp.server.com'
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=1
EMAIL_HOST_USER='your@email.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your-password'
```

#### Dependencies

To install new dependencies, for either base, prod or dev:

```bash
pip install <package>
pip freeze > requirements/base.txt
pip freeze > requirements/dev.txt
pip freeze > requirements/prod.txt
```

#### Migrations

To migrate database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### SuperUser

To create an admin user:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Run tests

To simply run all tests:

```bash
python manage.py test api
```

To check test coverage, we use `coverage` package that highlights which part of the codebase are being tested:

```bash
coverage run --source="." manage.py test api
coverage html
```

#### Model diagram

To generate a models diagram, we use `django-extensions` package that includes a diagram generator for all the implemented models found in the project, to use:

```bash
python manage.py graph_models -a -o models_diagram.png
```

### Frontend (React + Vite)

Vite provides automatic hot-reloading when frontend files are modified.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -it frontend sh
> ```

#### Dependencies

To install new dependencies, for either prod or dev:

```bash
npm install <package> --save-dev
npm install <package>
```

#### Run tests

## Core Models & Business Logic

### Barber Availability

Status: ‚úÖ

Barber availability is defined as a single record per barber per date, listing all 1-hour time slots during which the barber is available.

Model Example:

```json
{
  "barber": 3, // Barber ID associated to the availability
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00", "14:00", "15:00"]
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- Each time slot represents a fixed 1-hour window.
- Availability data is managed exclusively by admins.
- Only one availability entry is allowed per barber per date.

### Client Appointments

Status: ‚úÖ

Clients can book a single available slot with a barber on a specific date, along with one or more services offered by that barber.

Model Example:

```json
{
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slot": "09:00",
  "status": "ONGOING",
  "services": [4, 7] // Service IDs associated to the appointment
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- A client can only have **one** appointment with `status = "ONGOING"` at a time.
- The selected `slot` must: Exist in the barber‚Äôs availability for the specified date and not be already booked.

### Automated Tasks

Status: ‚úÖ

Used `Celery` deployed with 3 docker services, `Celery worker`, `Celery beat` and `Redis broker` to run these background tasks:

- Email reminders before 1 hour before appointment is due, sent to barber and client.
- Status updates (ONGOING ‚Üí COMPLETED) when the appointment is due.
- Powered by Celery Worker, Celery Beat, and Redis broker.

### Reviews

Status: ‚úÖ

Clients can submit a **single** review per barber, but **only** after completing an appointment. Each review is directly associated with both the barber and the related appointment.

Model Example:

```json
{
  "appointment": 101, // Appointment ID associated to the review
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "rating": 5, // Rating vote (1 - 5)
  "comment": "Great cut, very professional!"
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- One review per client per barber.
- Reviews are allowed **only** after the associated appointment is completed.

## Statistics

Status: ‚úÖ

Admin statistics dashboard includes:

- Total revenue
- Total appointments
- Review count
- Average barber rating

## Production Workflow

The site is **live** at:  
[https://barbermanager.creepymemes.com](https://barbermanager.creepymemes.com)

### Deployment

The deployment process is **fully automated** via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Every push to the `master` branch (excluding docs/meta files) triggers the CI/CD pipeline:

#### CI/CD Workflow Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Push to master] --> B[Run Tests]
    B -- Passed --> C[Deploy to Server]
    B -- Failed --> D[Fail: Not Deployed]
```

1. **Build & Test:**  
   Runs in a production-like Docker environment.
2. **Deploy Automatically:**  
   If tests pass, code is deployed to the server via SSH.

- Environment variables come from GitHub Secrets.
- Deployments use a custom `deploy.sh` script for zero downtime.
