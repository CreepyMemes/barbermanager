## Requirements

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed

## Installation & Startup

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreepyMemes/BarberManager.git
cd BarberManager/Implementazione
```

### 2. Build and Launch Services

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend available at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Using VSCode Dev Containers

When you open the project in VSCode, it detects the `.devcontainer` configurations for both frontend and backend:

- **Backend (Django)**: Uses container-based Python environment.
- **Frontend (React + Vite)**: Preconfigured with Prettier, ESLint, and other useful extensions.

### To Start:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3. Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

## Backend Development (Django API)

The Django server reloads automatically on code changes.

> [!TIP]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> If using from the host, prefix commands with:
>
> `docker-compose exec backend`.

### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install <package>
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create SuperUser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Run test cases

```bash
python manage.py test api
```

### Check test case coverage

This is a useful installed package `coverage` that highlights which part of the codebase are being tested, helps with developing testcases, to use:

```bash
# to run
coverage run --source="." manage.py test api

# To check results, generates htmlconv find index.html
coverage html

# Or just print retults in terminal
coverage report
```

### Generate model diagram

This is a useful installed package `django-extensions` that has many features, of which a diagram generator for all the implemented models found in the project, to use:

```bash
python manage.py graph_models -a -o models_diagram.png
```

## Frontend Development (React + Vite)

Vite provides automatic hot-reloading when frontend files are modified.

> [!TIP]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> If using from the host, prefix commands with:
>
> `docker-compose exec frontend`.

### Install npm Packages

```bash
npm install <package>
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports `3000` and `8000` are free or modify them in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Dev Container Not Opening**: Use `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the Command Palette.
- **Python Interpreter Issues**: Use `Python: Select Interpreter` in the Command Palette to choose the correct environment.

## Resetting the Environment

To fully reset and rebuild the environment:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker-compose up --build
```

## Entering the container shell from host machine

```bash
# For the frontend docker container
docker-compose exec -it frontend sh

# Or for the backend one
docker-compos exec -it backend sh
```

## Developer Notes

### Barber Availability

Barber availability is defined as a single record per barber per date, listing all 1-hour time slots during which the barber is available. Example:

```json
{
  "barber": 3,
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00", "14:00", "15:00"]
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- Each time slot represents a fixed 1-hour window.
- Availability data is managed exclusively by admins.
- Only one availability entry is allowed per barber per date.

### Client Appointments

Clients can book a single available slot with a barber on a specific date, along with one or more services offered by that barber. Example:

```json
{
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slot": "09:00",
  "status": "ONGOING",
  "services": [4, 7]
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- A client may have only **one** appointment with `status = "ONGOING"` at a time.
- The selected `slot` must:

  - Exist in the barberâ€™s availability for the specified date.
  - Not be already booked by another appointment.

### Reviews

Clients can submit a **single** review per barber, but **only** after completing an appointment. Each review is directly associated with both the barber and the related appointment. Example:

```json
{
  "appointment": 101,
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Great cut, very professional!"
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- One review per client per barber.
- Reviews are allowed **only** after the associated appointment is completed.
