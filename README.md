## Requirements

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed

# Development Workflow

This section is about the development workflow in programming and testing the application on local machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to run **VSCode** inside the backend container.
> When you open the project `backend` or `frontend` foldlers in **VSCode**,
> it shoullt automaticaly detect the `.devcontainer` configurations.
>
> If it doesn't detect it or you ignore the notification you can:
> Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
> Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

## 1. Clone the repository:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change **TOKEN** to your github token
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://CreepyMemes:TOKEN@github.com/CreepyMemes/BarberManager.git
> cd BarberManager/Implementazione
> ```

## 2. Build and launch development containers

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## To reset the environment

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

- Frontend available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend available at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Backend Development (Django API)

The Django dev server reloads automatically on code changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -it backend sh
> ```

### To install new python dependencies

```bash
pip install <package>

# If for both prod and dev
pip freeze > requirements/base.txt

# If for dev
pip freeze > requirements/dev.txt

# If for prod
pip freeze > requirements/prod.txt
```

### To run migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### to create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### To run test cases

```bash
python manage.py test api
```

### To check test case coverage

This is a useful installed package `coverage` that highlights which part of the codebase are being tested, helps with developing testcases, to use:

```bash
# to run
coverage run --source="." manage.py test api

# To check results, generates htmlconv find index.html
coverage html

# Or just print retults in terminal
coverage report
```

### To generate model diagram

This is a useful installed package `django-extensions` that has many features, of which a diagram generator for all the implemented models found in the project, to use:

```bash
python manage.py graph_models -a -o models_diagram.png
```

## Frontend Development (React + Vite)

Vite provides automatic hot-reloading when frontend files are modified.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following commands _inside_ the container.
> by running the following command:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec -it frontend sh
> ```

### To install new npm Packages

```bash
npm install <package>
```

## Developer Notes

### Barber Availability

Barber availability is defined as a single record per barber per date, listing all 1-hour time slots during which the barber is available. Example:

```json
{
  "barber": 3,
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slots": ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00", "14:00", "15:00"]
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- Each time slot represents a fixed 1-hour window.
- Availability data is managed exclusively by admins.
- Only one availability entry is allowed per barber per date.

### Client Appointments

Clients can book a single available slot with a barber on a specific date, along with one or more services offered by that barber. Example:

```json
{
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "date": "2025-05-20",
  "slot": "09:00",
  "status": "ONGOING",
  "services": [4, 7]
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- A client may have only **one** appointment with `status = "ONGOING"` at a time.
- The selected `slot` must:

  - Exist in the barberâ€™s availability for the specified date.
  - Not be already booked by another appointment.

### Reviews

Clients can submit a **single** review per barber, but **only** after completing an appointment. Each review is directly associated with both the barber and the related appointment. Example:

```json
{
  "appointment": 101,
  "client": 12,
  "barber": 3,
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Great cut, very professional!"
}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**

- One review per client per barber.
- Reviews are allowed **only** after the associated appointment is completed.

# Production Workflow

- The project will be available at: [http://barbermanager.creepymemes.com](http://barbermanager.creepymemes.com)

## Deployment

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
cd ~/projects/ && git clone https://CreepyMemes:TOKEN@github.com/CreepyMemes/barbermanager.git
```

### 2. Run the deploy script
